"""The single background heartbeat.

Exactly one instance of this runs per process. It is the *only* thing in the
system that talks to IBM. Every browser, tab and REST caller reads the snapshot
it leaves behind in the cache.

That is the central architectural decision of this project. The naive design --
each connected client fetching from IBM -- multiplies our request rate by the
number of viewers and gets the account rate-limited by the third open tab. Here,
request rate is a constant: one poll per `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, forever,
whether nobody or a hundred people are watching.

The second decision lives in :meth:`_build_snapshot`: **this coroutine does not
raise.** Any failure -- expired token, DNS blip, IBM maintenance, rate limit --
is caught, converted into simulated telemetry, and stamped ``source="mock"``
with a human-readable `degraded_reason`. The dashboard therefore has no error
state and no blank state; it degrades honestly and recovers by itself.
