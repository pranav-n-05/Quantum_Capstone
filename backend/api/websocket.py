"""WebSocket fan-out.

The endpoint here never calls IBM. It reads the cache the poller fills and
pushes it to whoever is connected -- which is exactly why opening twenty tabs
costs IBM nothing.

Broadcast is *per-client isolated*: one wedged or half-closed socket cannot
stall delivery to the others, and dead clients are reaped rather than retried.
